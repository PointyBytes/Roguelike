# My first Roguelike
Followed this [tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) and I would like to take it further. It may be because my favorite game growing up was Dungeonquest (Sv. Drakborgen). A board game where you play an adventurer in a race against time delving into a stronghold to get to the centers where the dragon sleeps on its massive treasure. The one with the most treasure who escapes before the sun sets is the winner.

## Things that I would like to add:
- Different types of levels
  - Larger rooms
  - Specialised rooms
  - Caves further down
  - Flowing water (transparent non walkable tiles)
  - Traps
- More enemies
  - Goblins
  - Skeletons
- More gear
- Stairs back up where you spawn on the new level.
- A surface level with a little village.
  - Economics for the surface village.
  - This could be a menu.
- A scoring system
- Light graphics or at least sprites


## Things to implement
- A central file that holds all setting variables
- Better key bindings
  - A file where all keys are listed and can be changed.
- Random damage range
- Degrading armor
